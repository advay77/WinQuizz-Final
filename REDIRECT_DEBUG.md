# Redirect Not Working - Debug Guide

## 🔍 What to Check

### 1. Open Browser Console (F12)
Look for these specific logs after clicking "Sign Up":

**Expected logs:**
```
🚀 Starting signup process...
Email: test@example.com
Phone: +911234567890
Full Name: Test User
✅ User created: <user-id>
⏳ Waiting for profile creation...
🔍 Checking if profile exists...
✅ Profile found: {...}
📝 Updating profile with phone and name...
✅ Profile updated successfully: [...]
🎉 Signup complete! Redirecting to verification...
🔄 Attempting navigation to /verify...
✅ Navigation triggered
```

**If you DON'T see "✅ Navigation triggered":**
- There's an error before navigation
- Check for any red error messages in console

### 2. Check for Errors

Look for these error patterns:

**Error 1: "User already registered"**
- Solution: Delete the user and try again
- Or use a different email

**Error 2: Profile creation fails**
- The code should still redirect
- Check if you see "❌ Profile creation error"

**Error 3: Navigation error**
- Should see "❌ Navigation error"
- Should automatically try window.location.href

### 3. Manual Test

Try these in browser console after signup:
```javascript
// Test 1: Check if user was created
supabase.auth.getUser().then(console.log)

// Test 2: Manual navigation
window.location.href = '/verify'
```

## 🛠️ Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
2. Clear "Cached images and files"
3. Refresh page (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### Fix 2: Check Network Tab
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Click "Sign Up"
4. Look for `/auth/v1/signup` request
5. Check if it returns 200 or error

### Fix 3: Try Different Email
If you see "User already registered":
- Use a completely new email
- Or delete the user from Supabase dashboard

### Fix 4: Hard Refresh
1. Close all browser tabs
2. Clear cache
3. Open fresh tab
4. Go to http://localhost:5173/auth
5. Try signup again

## 🎯 What Should Happen

### Correct Flow:
1. Fill signup form
2. Click "Sign Up" button
3. Button shows "Processing..."
4. Console shows signup logs
5. Toast shows "Account created! Redirecting..."
6. **Page redirects to /verify** (should happen in < 3 seconds)

### If Stuck on Auth Page:
- Check console for errors
- Look for the last log message
- See if navigation was attempted

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

I updated the code to:
1. ✅ Remove setTimeout delay - navigate immediately
2. ✅ Add try-catch around navigation
3. ✅ Fallback to window.location.href if navigate fails
4. ✅ Handle "user already exists" case
5. ✅ More detailed console logging
