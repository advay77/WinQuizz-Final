## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
3. Click **New Query**
4. Open the file `supabase-migration.sql` in your project root
5. Copy the entire SQL content and paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** to execute the migration

This will create:
- `quizzes` table - For managing quizzes
- `user_quiz_scores` table - For tracking quiz scores
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Indexes for better performance
- Role field in profiles table (if not exists)

### Step 2: Create Your First Admin User

After running the migration, you need to set at least one user as admin:

```sql
-- Replace 'your-user-email@example.com' with your actual email
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-user-email@example.com';
```

Run this query in the Supabase SQL Editor.

### Step 3: Verify the Setup

1. Log in to your application with the admin user account
2. Navigate to `/admin` route
3. You should see the admin dashboard with 6 tabs:
   - **Dashboard** - Overview and statistics
   - **Users** - User management with role assignment
   - **Quizzes** - Quiz lifecycle management
   - **Scores** - Quiz results and performance
   - **Questions** - Quiz question management
   - **KYC** - KYC requests (if applicable)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors
If you see TypeScript errors about 'never' types:
- These are expected before running the SQL migration
- Run the migration in Supabase
- Restart your development server
- The errors should disappear

### "Access Denied" Message
- Verify your user has role = 'admin' in the profiles table
- Run this query to check:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, email, role FROM public.profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
  ```
- If role is NULL or 'user', update it to 'admin'

### Tables Not Found
- Ensure you ran the complete SQL migration
- Check Supabase Table Editor to verify tables exist
- Look for: `quizzes` and `user_quiz_scores` tables

### Data Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify RLS policies are applied correctly
- Ensure your admin user is authenticated
