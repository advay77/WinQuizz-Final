# EmailJS as Primary Authenticator

## 🎯 Your Requirements

- ✅ Use Supabase ONLY for user storage (no auth verification)
- ✅ Use EmailJS for email verification
- ✅ Use Twilio for phone verification
- ✅ No RLS policies (they're causing issues)
- ✅ Direct database access

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Disable RLS Completely

**Run this SQL**: `DISABLE_RLS_FIX.sql`

This will:
- ✅ Disable RLS on profiles table
- ✅ Remove all policies (no more recursion errors)
- ✅ Remove trigger (not needed)
- ✅ Grant full access to authenticated users

### Step 2: How It Works Now

**Signup Flow:**
1. User fills form
2. Supabase creates auth user (just for login)
3. **Code creates profile directly** (no RLS blocking)
4. Redirect to /verify
5. **EmailJS sends OTP** for email
6. **Twilio sends OTP** for phone
7. User verifies both
8. Access dashboard

**Supabase is used for:**
- ✅ User accounts (email/password login)
- ✅ Profile storage (no verification)
- ✅ Database storage

**EmailJS/Twilio are used for:**
- ✅ Email verification (primary)
- ✅ Phone verification (primary)
- ✅ OTP generation and sending

## 🔧 Current Code Behavior

After running `DISABLE_RLS_FIX.sql`:
- ✅ No 500 errors (RLS disabled)
- ✅ No 401 errors (no policies)
- ✅ No recursion errors (policies removed)
- ✅ Profile creation works
- ✅ Redirect works
- ✅ EmailJS/Twilio handle verification

## 📊 What You'll See

**Console output:**
```
🚀 Starting signup process...
✅ User created: <id>
📝 Creating profile...
✅ Profile created successfully: { phone: '+911234567890' }
🎉 Signup complete! Redirecting...
✅ Navigation triggered
```

**On /verify page:**
- Click "Send Code" for email → EmailJS sends OTP
- Click "Send Code" for phone → Twilio sends OTP
- Enter OTPs → Verify → Dashboard

## 🎉 Benefits

- ✅ **No Supabase auth verification** - Just storage
- ✅ **EmailJS is primary** - Handles email verification
- ✅ **Twilio is primary** - Handles phone verification
- ✅ **No RLS issues** - Disabled completely
- ✅ **Fast and simple** - Direct database access
